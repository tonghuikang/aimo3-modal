# AIMO 3 template code

This is some template code where you can use to serve vLLM and solve [AI Mathematical Olympaid 3](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-3).

Please read the [Kaggle discussions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-3/discussion/643580) post for more context.


# Setup

Run `uv sync` to install packages in `.venv`


# Deploy inference

```
uv run modal deploy inference.py
```

When deployed, you can visit to see available models

```
https://<handle>--example-gpt-oss-inference-serve.modal.run/v1/models
```


You will need to save the url to `env.json`. It should look something like

```
{
  "REMOTE_VLLM_URL": "https://<handle>--example-gpt-oss-inference-serve.modal.run/v1"
}
```


# Solve problems

```
uv run python3 kaggle.py
```

You should see problems being solved.

The same code could be used on Kaggle.
